# Build Horizontally Scalable Real-Time Applications with NodeRoom

NodeRoom is a Node.js framework for building horizontally scalable real-time applications. It is built on top of [Express](http://expressjs.com/). It does not use WebSockets, but instead uses SSE (Server Sent Events) to achieve real-time communication.

>NodeRoom is a work in progress. It is not ready for production use.

---

## Core Concept
Building block of NodeRoom is `node` which consist of two major parts:

1. `Controller` - A function that handles the database operations and returns the data to the node.

2. `Invalidator` - A set of conditions that determines when the data returned by the controller is outdated and needs to be refreshed.

### Node Types
NodeRoom supports two types of nodes:

1. `Query` - A node that is responsible for fetching data from the database.

2. `Mutation` - A node that is responsible for updating the database.

### Node Room
NodeRoom groups the similar nodes into `room`. A room is a collection of nodes that share the same task. Any of the query nodes in a room can be subscribed to by the client. When a query node is subscribed to, the client will receive the data returned by the controller of the node. The client will also receive the updates to the data as and when the data is invalidated and the controller is called again.

When a mutation node in the room invalidates any of the query nodes, the client is notified with the updated data. Client can only subscribe to the query nodes in a room. It cannot subscribe to the mutation nodes but it can call the mutation nodes of the room.

> You can have multiple rooms in a single application. Each room can have multiple nodes. ðŸ˜‡

## Enough Theory, Show Me Some Code

### Requirements
1. Node.js >= 6.0.0

### Installation
```bash
npm install node-room
```
### How to create a `Node`?
```js
import { Node , nTrue, Query} from 'node-room';

@Node({ id: 'id', mode: 'R', labels: [{ label: 'MY_LABEL', when: nTrue() }] })
export class MyFirstNode {
    
    @Query()
    async fetch(param1, param2) {
        // Do some database operations and return the data
        // Below is just a dummy code

        // Start of dummy code
        const database = new MyDatabase();
        const result = await database.giveMeSomeResult(param1, param2);
        return result;
        // End of dummy code
    }

}
```

Practically node is nothing but a class with a `fetch` method. The `fetch` method is responsible for fetching the data from the database. The `fetch` method can take any number of parameters. The parameters are passed to the `fetch` method by the client when it subscribes to the node.

The `@Node` decorator is used to decorate the class. It takes an object as an argument. The object has the following properties:

1. `id` - If your query node is returning the array of rows from the database, then you can specify the `id` property. The `id` property is used to uniquely identify the rows in the array. The `id` property is used to determine which rows are added, removed or updated in the array. If the `id` property is not specified, then the whole array is sent to the client whenever the data is invalidated which is not very efficient. We only send the `delta` to the client but in case of array without `id` property, we have to send the whole array.

2. `mode` - The mode of the node. It can be either `R`, `D`, `U` or `C`. `R` stands for `Read`, `D` stands for `Delete`, `U` stands for `Update` and `C` stands for `Create`. The mode is used to determine the type of the node. If the mode is `R`, then the node is a `Query` node. If the mode is `D`, `U` or `C`, then the node is a `Mutation` node.

3. `labels` - An array of labels. Each label has a `label` property and a `when` property. The `label` property is the name of the label. The `when` property is a function that returns a boolean value. The `when` function is used to determine whether the node should be labeled with the given label or not. The `when` function takes three arguments: 

    1. `selfParamObject` - An object containing the parameters passed to the `fetch` method of the node. It is the same object that is passed to the `fetch` method by the client when it subscribes or calls the node.

    2. `mutationNodeParamObject` - An object containing the parameters passed to the `fetch` method of the mutation node that invalidated the node. It is the same object that is passed to the `fetch` method by the client when it calls the mutation node.

    3. `mutationNodeType` - The type of the mutation node that invalidated the node. It can be either `D`, `U` or `C`. `D` stands for `Delete`, `U` stands for `Update` and `C` stands for `Create`.

    The `when` function should return `true` if the node should be labeled with the given label and `false` otherwise. Use those three arguments to determine whether the node should be labeled with the given label or not.

    When the mutation node invalidates the node, we check the labels of the node. If the node has any label that matches the label of the mutation node, then the node is invalidated. If the node does not have any label that matches the label of the mutation node, then the node is not invalidated.

    > You can reuse your whenFunction in multiple labels. You can also use the same label in multiple nodes. So try to store labels in a separate file and reuse them.

    **Modification node** is always labeled with the given labels irrespective of the `whenFunction`. So you can use the built in whenFunction called as `nTrue` that always return true.


### How to create `room` and add `node` to it ?

```js
import { Room } from 'node-room';
import { MyFirstNode } from './my-first-node';
 
 @Room('MyUniqueRoomName')
 export class MyFirstNodeRoom {
    public myFirstNode = MyFirstNode
    // add all your node here as public property
}
```

Practically room is nothing but a class with node as public property. The `@Room` decorator is used to decorate the class. It takes the name of the room as an argument. The name of the room should be unique. You can have multiple rooms in a single application. Each room can have multiple nodes.

### Let's add the room to the application and start the server

```js
    import express from 'express';
    import { NodeRoom } from 'node-room';
    import { MyFirstNodeRoom } from './my-first-node-room';

    const APP = express();
    APP.use(express.json());

    // add node room the application
    const NODE_ROOM_APP = NodeRoom.init(APP,{ clientKillTimeout: 100000, rooms: [TodoRoom], storage: DFStore, broker: NodeBroker, strategy: 'cacheWithClient' }).app();

    // start the server
    NODE_APP.listen(3000, () => {
        console.log('Server started at port 3000');
    });
```

The `NodeRoom.init` method takes three arguments:

1. `app` - The express application.

2. `options` - An object containing the following properties:

    1. `clientKillTimeout` - The time in `milliseconds` after which the client is disconnected if it does not send any message to the server. After the client is disconnected it cannot receive any changes from the server.

    2. `rooms` - An array of rooms. The rooms that you want to add to the application.

    3. `storage` - The storage that you want to use. You can also create your own storage. The storage should implement the `INodeStorage` interface. This is key value storage. You can use any famous key value storage like `Redis`, `MongoDB`, `LevelDB`, `Memcached` etc. If you are planning to use single server, then just use Map as storage.

    4. `broker` - The broker that you want to use. You can also create your own broker. The broker should implement the `INodeBroker` interface. You can use any famous message broker like `RabbitMQ`, `Kafka`, `Redis` etc. If you are planning to use single server, then just use `EventEmitterManager` from node-room as broker.

    5. `strategy` - The strategy can be either `cacheWithClient` or `cacheThenClient`. The `cacheWithClient` strategy means that the subscribers of the room will receive the changes once the modification node is completed. The `cacheThenClient` strategy means that the subscribers of the room will receive the changes once the modification node is completed and the cache is updated. The `cacheWithClient` strategy reduces the latency but it can increase the query to master database. The `cacheThenClient` strategy increases the latency slightly but it reduces the query to master database significantly. So choose the strategy according to your use case. We will discuss about the strategies in detail in the next section.

### How to make custom storage for single server instance ?

```js
import { INodeStorage } from 'node-room';

export class DFStore implements INodeStorage {
    private store = new Map();

    constructor() {}

    async add(key: string, value: string) {
        this.store.set(key, value);
    }

    async get(key: string) {
        return this.store.get(key);
    }

    async remove(key: string) {
        this.store.delete(key);
    }
}
```

### How to make custom broker for single server instance ?

```js
import { INodeBroker , EventEmitterManager} from 'node-room';

export class NodeBroker implements INodeBroker {
   constructor() {}

    public async publish(msg: string) {
        EventEmitterManager.getInstance().emit('msg', msg);
    }

    public async subscribe(callback: (msg: string) => void) {
        EventEmitterManager.getInstance().on('msg', callback);
    }
}
```

### Is NodeRoom same as react-query ?

No , NodeRoom is not same as react-query. NodeRoom is more like socket.io.

NodeRoom is designed with following goals in mind:

1. It should be easy to use.

2. It should be compatible with any databases.

3. It should be horizontally scalable.

4. It should reduce the load on master database by intelligently caching the data.

5. It should consume as less network bandwidth as possible.

6. It should uplift the client side state management libraries like mobx, redux etc. on the server side. So that developers can ship less javascript code to the client with less memory footprint.

7. It should be easy to integrate with existing applications as middleware without changing the existing code.

Please note that react-query may not be able to fulfill all the above goals. It is designed to solve a different problem. It is designed to solve the problem of fetching data from the server. It is not designed to solve the problem of syncing data between the server and the client. So it is not a replacement of NodeRoom.

> NodeRoom intelligently sync the data between the server and the client by only sending delta.

Imagine thousands of rows in which only some properties of single row is changed due to mutation node. NodeRoom will only send the changed properties of that single row to the client. It will not send the entire rows again. So it will reduce the network bandwidth significantly unlike react-query.

### How to talk to NodeRoom from client ?

You can use `node-room-client` package to talk to NodeRoom from client. You can find the documentation of `node-room-client` [here]( https://github.com/node-room/node-room-client ) .

This is core client library. We extended this library to create `react-node`. You can find the documentation of `react-node` [here](https://github.com/node-room/react-node) . This is react specific library. You can use this library to talk to NodeRoom from react application.

If you are using Angular the just use `node-room-client` package. You can use `node-room-client` package with any framework. You can also use `node-room-client` package with plain javascript.

> Please note that we currently do not support `pure http client` like `axios`. We are working on it. We will release it soon.

> Pure http client can be used by the third party server for the purpose of calling mutation node.

### How to make mutation node ?

```js
import { Node , nTrue} from 'node-room';

@Node({ mode: 'U', labels: [{ label: 'MY_FIRST_MUTATION_NODE', when: nTrue() }] })
export class UpdateSomething {
    
    @Query()
    async fetch(param1, param2) {
        // You can check the param1 and param2 here if you want for security purpose.
        // Just throw an error if you want to stop the execution of the node and send the error to the client.

       // perform your update operation here
       // below is just a dummy code

       const myDatabase = new MyDatabase();
       return myDatabase.updateSomething(param1, param2);
       
       // end of dummy code
    }
}
```

Note that we have used `U` as mode. This means that this node is a mutation node or more specifically an update node. You can also use `C` for create node and `D` for delete node.

Also we have used `nTrue()` as when function for one of our label `MY_FIRST_MUTATION_NODE`. This means that this label will be applied to the node because `nTrue` always returns true no matter what. Currently we encourage to use `nTrue` as when function for all mutation nodes.

### How to make query node ?

```js
import { Node , nTrue} from 'node-room';
import {someWhenFunction} from './when-functions';

@Node({ id: '_id' mode: 'R', labels: [{ label: 'MY_FIRST_QUERY_NODE', when: someWhenFunction() }] })
export class FetchSomething {
    
    @Query()
    async fetch(param1, param2) {
        // You can check the param1 and param2 here if you want for security purpose.
        // Just throw an error if you want to stop the execution of the node and send the error to the client.

       // perform your query operation here
       // below is just a dummy code

       const myDatabase = new MyDatabase();
       return myDatabase.fetchSomething(param1, param2);
       
       // end of dummy code
    }
}
```

Note that we have used `R` as mode. This means that this node is a query node. 

Also we have used `someWhenFunction` as when function for one of our label `MY_FIRST_QUERY_NODE`. This means that this label will be applied to the node if `someWhenFunction` returns true.

### Intelligent caching strategy for query node

We have implemented intelligent caching strategy for query node. NodeRoom will cache the result of the query node for a particular **set of parameters**. If the same query node is called with the same set of parameters then NodeRoom will return the cached result instead of calling the master database. This will **significantly reduce the load on the master database** and will make your application **blazing fast**.

In the **given room** NodeRoom considers the node subscription as duplicate if the following conditions are met.

1. The node is a query node.
2. The node is subscribed with the same set of parameters.

Duplicate node always returns the cached result. If the cached result is not available then it will call the master database and then cache the result. 

Upon receiving the mutation node NodeRoom will invalidate the cache of affected duplicate nodes. This will ensure that the duplicate nodes will always return the latest result.

> Obviously the mutation is not cached. So the mutation node will always call the master database.
